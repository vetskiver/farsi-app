Use Supabase for user login and signup with email and password.

Use Supabase to store vocabulary, cloze sentences, and user progress.

The vocabulary table should have:

id, user_id, english, farsi, cloze_sentence, created_at, updated_at.

Create three study modes:

English → Farsi

Farsi → English

Cloze Mode (sentence with a missing word).

Let users add, edit, and delete vocabulary words.

Use the OpenAI API to generate cloze sentences through a Supabase Edge Function.

Save practice stats:

Number of reviews

Correct/incorrect answers

Last review date

Keep the design simple and uncluttered so users can review words quickly.

Add keyboard shortcuts for faster practice.

Deploy to Vercel and store Supabase + OpenAI keys in environment variables.

Build the app in stages:

Authentication

Vocabulary management (CRUD)

Flashcard modes

AI features.

Keep all AI calls secure by running them on the backend through serverless functions.
